# ADR 0. Title

Status: Active or Obsolete (leave a link to ADR that cancels this one) or Proposed

## Context

Describes the forces at play: technological, political, social, and project local.
It is simply describing facts in value-neutral language.

Older ADRs can also be contexts, because large-scale decisions can create space for smaller ones.

## Decision

This section describes our response to these forces described in the context section.
It is stated in full sentences, with active voice.

## Consequence

This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision.

All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones.
A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences,
but all of them affect the team and project in the future.
